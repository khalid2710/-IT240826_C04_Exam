Can tell me confirm it is automatic calculation is turned on in Excel?
Have you checked if the "Show Formulas" option is enabled in the Excel settings?
Are there any specific cel that are particularly problematic, or is it a widespread issue throughout the spreadsheet?
Would you describe exactly the problem you're having your Excel spreadsheet
Has the problem occurred before ?
What was running when the problem occurred?
Does the problem occur in any other application?
How long had the system been running when the problem occurred?
